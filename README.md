TECHNICAL TASK:

Using the Google Maps APIs, we require a page that allows a user to view and search a map and listing of pre-defined UK locations.

Map locations should be stored and retrieved from a MySQL database and the ability to add and store additional map points using a form should be added.

Required map locations are:
·  London
·  Edinburgh
·  Cardiff
·  Belfast
·  Normanton
·  Boston
·  Leeds
·  Manchester
 
Users need the ability to search for their location and find the nearest map location. The closest map location result should display how far from their searched location the map location is and how long it will take to travel there by car.

Bonus points if users can view the list of map locations in distance order showing how long it will take to travel to each location by driving.
